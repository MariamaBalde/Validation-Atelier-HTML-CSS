            <h2>meet marie-josée and alon</h2><br>
            <p class="p2">Our story began in 2005, when two travelers, Alon Farber and Marie-Josée Richer, fell in love
                and returned to Quebec after meeting in India,<br> where they had started a vegan seasonal restaurant in
                Goa. Driven by a desire to have positive impact on people lives and respond to social and
                environmental<br> issues, they used entrepreneurship as a driver of change by sharing their love of food
                and passion for healthy nutrition. Modestly, they started out roasting nuts<br> in Marie-Josée’s mom’s
                kitchen and selling their tasty treats through word-of-mouth and farmer’s markets. With consumers
                support and love, the business<br> took off and Prana today touches people from East to West, being an
                organic industry leader and <br>Canada's # 1 organic snack brand.
